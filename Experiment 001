There was a time I was happy. I wish I knew what changed... because then I could fix it. 

We all wish we could fix things. We're used to fixing things. A lot of things are fixable. Tables, doors, cars, relationships... well, sometimes. Other times, we replace, convincing ourselves it's the same as fixing.

You have to be careful about replacing things. You search long and hard to find that thing that can fill that hole. It may not fit quite right, but it's close enough. Then you go searching for something else to fill those gaps that are left over. And they don't fit quite right, either. So, you make the gaps a little bit bigger, and you play with their shapes. Only that's not quite right either. You soon become a collection of patches for holes you created yourself.

Fixing things is much harder. We know that. You have to recognize that something is broken. That can be hard, but not always. That really depends on what's broken, and why... and how... and when... yeah, it's complicated. The hard part is living with something that's broken. And if it's hard to fix, we could be living with it for a while. That's when we rush to replace things.

Fixing things requires persistence...acceptance... forgiveness. Afterall, why else would you let a broken table, door, car... or relationship... stay in your life? You can't get right to work either. You have to learn about it... understand it. That extra time... it's like a healing process.
